You have been tasked with building a prototype responsive movie review website.

Using the target image files as a reference, and the specification below, build the prototype website using relevant CSS techniques (including CSS grid and flexbox) so that it displays accurately across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

The website should be responsive across all devices, however your media query breakpoints will be tested on the following viewport widths:

* Standard resolution mobile. Portrait - viewport width of up to (and including) 480px.
* Large mobile/tablet. Portrait - viewport width between 481px and 1024px.
* Tablet/laptop. Landscape - viewport width of 1025px and above.

Specifications:

1. The maximum width of the inner container should be constrained to 1280px. The main header should always take up the full width of the page.
2. The desktop version (1025px and above) should show items in a grid of 1 column on the left, with 2 columns on the right. The larger column on the left should be 2x the size of a single column on the right.
3. The mobile / tablet version (between 481px and 1024px) should show items in a grid of 1 column on the left, with 1 column on the right. The larger column on the left sould be 2x the size of the single column on the right.
4. The mobile version (up to and including 480px) should show one column of items in a grid, the search bar and nav in the menu should be hidden, and the mobile 'Menu' shown on the right instead.
5. Image sizes are *not* specified, as these shall be determined by the size of their containers, but should be equal / relative to each other where neccessary.
6. 20px should be used for all padding and gaps.
7. The css colour 'dodgerblue' should be used for the header colour.
8. Box shadows are 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2), offset 2,2px for main items, and 0,0px for the header.
